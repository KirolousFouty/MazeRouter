Input:
5, 5, 10, 50
net1 (0, 0, 0) (0, 2, 2)
net2 (0, 4, 4) (0, 2, 2)

Output:
Routing net 'net1' with pins: [(0, 0, 0), (0, 2, 2)]

Net 'net1' routed with the length for optimal path 6
Net 'net1' routed with a total of 0 vias.
Net 'net1' routed successfully with final path cost: 18

Routing net 'net2' with pins: [(0, 4, 4), (0, 2, 2)]
Net 'net2' could not be routed.
The length of the longest route net is: 6 for net 'net1'
Total number of wires or paths for all nets combined: 6
