Input:
5, 5, 10, 50
OBS(0, 2, 2)
net1 (0, 1, 1) (0, 3, 3)
net2 (0, 1, 3) (0, 3, 1)

Output:
Routing net 'net1' with pins: [(0, 1, 1), (0, 3, 3)]
Net 'net1' routed with the optimal path [(0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 3)]
Net 'net1' routed with the length for optimal path 6
Net 'net1' routed with a total of 0 vias.
Net 'net1' routed successfully with final path cost: 18

Routing net 'net2' with pins: [(0, 1, 3), (0, 3, 1)]
Start node (1, 3) is already blocked by a previous net's path.
The length of the longest route net is: 6 for net 'net1'
Total number of wires or paths for all nets combined: 6
Total number of vias for all nets combined: 0
