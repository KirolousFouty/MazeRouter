Input:
5, 5, 20, 30
OBS (0, 2, 2)
net1 (0, 0, 0) (0, 4, 4)
net2 (0, 1, 0) (1, 3, 3)

Output:
Routing net 'net2' with pins: [(0, 1, 0), (1, 3, 3)]
Net 'net2' routed with the optimal path [(0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (1, 1, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 3)]
Net 'net2' routed with the length for optimal path 8
Net 'net2' routed with a total of 1 vias.
Net 'net2' routed successfully with final path cost: 35

Routing net 'net1' with pins: [(0, 0, 0), (0, 4, 4)]
Net 'net1' routed with the optimal path [(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2), (0, 0, 3), (0, 0, 4), (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 4)]
Net 'net1' routed with the length for optimal path 10
Net 'net1' routed with a total of 0 vias.
Net 'net1' routed successfully with final path cost: 36
The length of the longest route net is: 10 for net 'net1'
Total number of wires or paths for all nets combined: 18
Total number of vias for all nets combined: 1

Result: Success Test
